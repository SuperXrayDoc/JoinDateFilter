Join Date Filter v 1.0.0
Created by Xray_Doc

This mod was mostly made as a way for me to learn Java as I'm mostly a Python and C programmer. Expect the programming to look like amateur garbage.

Installation:
Have forge installed
Place JoinDateFilter.jar into your .minecraft/mods folder
Run the forge installation

Config:
To adjust the cut-off date go into your mods button in-game and find Join Date Filter. Click config and edit the values to your desired parameters.

Whitelist names are stored in .minecraft/JoinDateFilter/whitelist.txt
Add whitelist names to this text file for their messages to ignore your join date filter.

Dates and names of people logged are stored within .minecraft/JoinDateFilter/dates.txt

IMPORTANT:
Messages will always show up at least once if the person hasn't been logged yet since it takes time to get join date info from the server. After that they will be filtered.

This mod only works on Constantiam. If you use it on another server it will spam your chat with "Unknown command". This is because I don't know how to limit the mod to only constantiam. If someone knows please reach out to me.
To prevent this just disable the mod in the mod config gui in-game.
